<h3><s>WHAT IS COUNTRY AESTHETIC?</s></h3>
<p><b>The country aesthetic is based on the culture of rural farming populations in the American South and Midwest. 
Farmers and ranchers within the community value tradition and conservative ideals, community, and hard work in their field.
The aesthetic places great emphasis on practicality, with a range of activities and items originating from their work and landscape.
